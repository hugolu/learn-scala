## Functor Laws
LYAHFGG: In order for something to be a functor, it should satisfy some laws. All functors are expected to exhibit certain kinds of functor-like properties and behaviors. … 
- The first functor law states that if we map the id function over a functor, the functor that we get back should be the same as the original functor.
- The second law says that composing two functions and then mapping the resulting function over a functor should be the same as first mapping one function over the functor and then mapping the other one.
