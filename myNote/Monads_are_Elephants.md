## Equality for All
Using triple equals in `f(x) ≡ g(x)` as a mathematician uses "=" for equality.

## Breaking the Law
If a, b, and c are rational numbers then multiplication (*) obeys the following laws:
```
a * 1 ≡ a
a * b ≡ b * a
(a * b) * c ≡ a * (b * c)
```
Certainly it would be easy to create a class called "RationalNumber" and implement a * operator. But if it didn't follow these laws the result would be confusing to say the least.
