# Polymorphism

Polymorphism means that a function type comes **in many forms**.

In programming it means that 
- the function can be applied to arguments of many types
- the type can have instances of many types

Two principal forms of polymorphism:
- subtyping: instances of a subcalss can be passed to a base class.
- generics: instances of a function or class are created by type parameterization.
