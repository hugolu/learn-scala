# Next Steps in Scala

## Step 7. Parameterize arrays with types

In Scala, you can instantiate objects, or class instances, using `new`. When you instantiate an object in Scala, you can *parameterize* it with values and types. Parameterization means “configuring” an instance when you create it.

When you parameterize an instance with both a type and a value, the type comes first in its square brackets, followed by the value in parentheses.

test.scala:
```scala
val greetingStrings = new Array[String](3)
greetingStrings(0) = "Hello"
greetingStrings(1) = ", "
greetingStrings(2) = "World!\n"

for (i <- 0 to 2)
  print(greetingStrings(i))
```
```shell
$ scala test.scala
Hello, World!
```

When you define a variable with `val`, the variable can’t be reassigned, but the object to which it refers could potentially still be changed.

When you apply parentheses surrounding one or more values to a variable, Scala will transform the code into an invocation of a method named apply on that variable.
- `greetStrings(i)` ➾ `greetStrings.apply(i)`
- `1 + 2` ➾ `(1).+(2)`

Scala provides a more concise way to create and initialize ar- rays that you would normally use.
```scala
val nums1 = Array[String](3)
nums(0) = "zero"
nums(1) = "one"
nums(2) = "two"
```
```scala
val nums = Array("zero", "one", "two")
```
- it's a factory method, named `apply`, which creates and returns the new array. This `apply` method takes a variable number of arguments and is defined on the `Array` companion object.
