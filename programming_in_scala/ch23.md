# For Expressions Revisited

## 23.1 For expressions
a *for* expression is of the form: `for ( seq ) yield expr`
- *seq* is a sequence of *generators*, *definitions*, and *filters*, with semicolons between successive elements. 

```scala
case class Foo(value: Int)

val foos = List(Foo(1), Foo(2), Foo(3))         //> foos  : List[myTest.Foo] = List(Foo(1), Foo(2), Foo(3))

for {
  foo <- foos                                   // a generator
  v = foo.value                                 // a definition
  if (v % 2 != 0)                               // a filter
} yield v                                       //> res0: List[Int] = List(1, 3)
```

A *generator* is of the form: `pat <- expr`
- The expression *expr* typically returns a list, even though you will see later that this can be generalized. The pattern *pat* gets matched one-by-one against all elements of that list.

A *definition* is of the form: `pat = expr`
- This definition binds the pattern *pat* to the value of *expr*. So it has the same effect as a `val` definition: `val x = expr`

A *filter* is of the form: `if expr`
- Here, *expr* is an expression of type Boolean. The filter drops from the iteration all elements for which *expr* returns `false`.

## 23.2 The n-queens problem
Given a standard chess-board, place eight queens such that no queen is in check from any other (a queen can check another piece if they are on the same column, row, or diagonal).

An imperative solution to this problem would place queens one by one, moving them around on the board. But it looks difficult to come up with a scheme that really tries all possibilities.

A more functional approach represents a solution directly, as a value. A solution consists of a list of coordinates, one for each queen placed on the board. Note, however, that a full solution can not be found in a single step. It needs to be built up gradually, by occupying successive rows with queens.
- This suggests a recursive algorithm.

```scala
def queens(n: Int): List[List[(Int, Int)]] = {
  def placeQueens(k: Int): List[List[(Int, Int)]] =
    if (k == 0)
      List(List())
    else for {
      queens <- placeQueens(k - 1)
      column <- 1 to n
      queen = (k, column)
      if isSafe(queen, queens)
    } yield queen :: queens
  placeQueens(n)
}                                               //> queens: (n: Int)List[List[(Int, Int)]]

def isSafe(queen: (Int, Int), queens: List[(Int, Int)]) =
  queens forall (q => !inCheck(queen, q))       //> isSafe: (queen: (Int, Int), queens: List[(Int, Int)])Boolean

def inCheck(q1: (Int, Int), q2: (Int, Int)) =
  q1._1 == q2._1 || // same row
  q1._2 == q2._2 || // same column
  (q1._1 - q2._1).abs == (q1._2 - q2._2).abs // on diagonal
                                                //> inCheck: (q1: (Int, Int), q2: (Int, Int))Boolean

queens(4)                                       //> res0: List[List[(Int, Int)]] = List(List((4,3), (3,1), (2,4), (1,2)), List((
                                                //| 4,2), (3,4), (2,1), (1,3)))
```
- The first generator of that for expression iterates through all solutions of placing `k - 1` queens on the board.
- The second generator iterates through all possible columns on which the k’th queen might be placed.
- The third part of the for expression defines the newly considered queen position to be the pair consisting of row k and each produced column.
- The fourth part of the for expression is a filter which checks with isSafe whether the new queen is safe from check of all previous queens.
- If the new queen is not in check from any other queens, it can form part of a partial solution, so placeQueens generates with `queen :: queens` a new solution. If the new queen is not safe from check, the filter returns `false`, so no solution is generated.

## 23.3 Querying with for expressions
```scala
case class Book(title: String, authors: String*)
val books: List[Book] =
  List(
    Book(
      "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs",
      "Abelson, Harold", "Sussman, Gerald J."),
    Book(
      "Principles of Compiler Design",
      "Aho, Alfred", "Ullman, Jeffrey"),
    Book(
      "Programming in Modula-2",
      "Wirth, Niklaus"),
    Book(
      "Elements of ML Programming",
      "Ullman, Jeffrey"),
    Book(
      "The Java Language Specification",
      "Gosling, James", "Joy, Bill", "Steele, Guy", "Bracha, Gilad"))
```
### to find the titles of all books whose author’s last name is “Gosling”:
```scala
for (
  b <- books; a <- b.authors if a startsWith "Gosling"
) yield b.title                                 //> res0: List[String] = List(The Java Language Specification)
```

### to find the titles of all books that have the string “Program” in their title:
```scala
for (b <- books if (b.title indexOf "Program") >= 0)
  yield b.title                                 //> res1: List[String] = List(Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,
                                                //|  Programming in Modula-2, Elements of ML Programming)
```

### to find the names of all authors that have written at least two books in the database:
```scala
val authors = for (
  b1 <- books; b2 <- books if b1 != b2;
  a1 <- b1.authors; a2 <- b2.authors if a1 == a2
) yield a1                                      //> authors  : List[String] = List(Ullman, Jeffrey, Ullman, Jeffrey)

def removeDuplicates[A](xs: List[A]): List[A] = {
  if (xs.isEmpty) xs
  else
    xs.head :: removeDuplicates(
      xs.tail filter (x => x != xs.head))
}                                               //> removeDuplicates: [A](xs: List[A])List[A]

removeDuplicates(authors)                       //> res2: List[String] = List(Ullman, Jeffrey)
```

## 23.4 Translation of for expressions
Every for expression can be expressed in terms of the three higher-order functions `map`, `flatMap`, and `withFilter`.

### Translating `for` expressions with one *generator*
```scala
for (x <- expr1) yield expr2
```
where x is a variable. Such an expression is translated to:
```scala
expr1.map(x => expr2)
```

### Translating `for` expressions starting with a *generator* and a *filter*
```scala
for (x <- expr1 if expr2) yield expr3
```
is translated to:
```scala
for (x <- expr1 withFilter (x => expr2)) yield expr3
```
The translation then continues with this second expression, so in the end you obtain:
```scala
expr1 withFilter (x => expr2 ) map (x => expr3 )
```
If *seq* is an arbitrary sequence of *generators*, *definitions* and *filters*, then:
```scala
for (x <- expr1 if expr2; seq) yield expr3
```
is translated to:
```scala
for (x <- expr1 withFilter expr2; seq) yield expr3
```

### Translating `for` expressions starting with two *generators*
```scala
for (x <- expr1; y <- expr2; seq) yield expr3
```
The for expression above is translated to an application of `flatMap`:
```scala
expr1.flatMap(x => for (y <- expr2; seq) yield expr3)
```

```scala
val xs = List(1, 2, 3, 4)                       //> xs  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
val ys = List(1, 2, 3, 4)                       //> ys  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

for {
  x <- xs if x % 2 != 0
  y <- ys if y % 2 == 0
} yield (x, y)                                  //> res0: List[(Int, Int)] = List((1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4))

xs withFilter (_ % 2 != 0) flatMap (x =>
  ys withFilter (_ % 2 == 0) map (y =>
    (x, y)))                                    //> res1: List[(Int, Int)] = List((1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4))
```
### Translating patterns in generators
```scala
for ((x1, ..., xn) <- expr1) yield expr2
```
translates to:
```scala
expr1 .map { case (x1 , ..., xn ) => expr2 }
```

Things become a bit more involved if the left hand side of the generator is an arbitrary pattern *pat* instead of a single variable or a tuple. In this case:
```scala
for (pat <- expr1) yield expr2
```
translates to:
```scala
expr1 withFilter {
  case pat => true
  case _ => false
} map {
  case pat => expr2
}
```
That is, the generated items are first filtered and only those that match *pat* are mapped. Therefore, it’s guaranteed that a pattern-matching generator will never throw a `MatchError`.

### Translating definitions
```scala
for (x <- expr1; y = expr2; seq) yield expr3
```
This expression is translated to the following one:
```scala
for ((x, y) <- for (x <- expr1) yield (x, expr2); seq)
yield expr3
```
So you see that expr2 is evaluated each time there is a new x value being generated. This re-evaluation is necessary, because `expr2` might refer to x and so needs to be re-evaluated for changing values of x.

### Translating `for` loops
```scala
for (x <- expr1) body
```
translates to:
```scala
expr1 foreach (x => body)
```

A larger example is the expression:
```scala
for (x <- expr1; if expr2; y <- expr3) body
```
This expression translates to:
```scala
expr1 withFilter (x => expr2) foreach (x => expr3 foreach (y => body))
```

```scala
val xss = List(List(1,2,3), List(4,5,6), List(7,8,9))
var sum: Int = 0                                //> sum  : Int = 0

sum = 0
for (xs <- xss; x <- xs) sum += x
println(sum)                                    //> 45

sum = 0
xss foreach (xs =>
	xs foreach (x =>
		sum += x))
println(sum)                                    //> 45
```

## 23.5 Going the other way
- `for` expressions can be translated into applications of the higher-order functions `map`, `flatMap`, and `withFilter`.
- every application of a `map`, `flatMap`, or `filter` can be represented as a `for` expression.

```scala
val list = List.range(0, 5)                     //> list  : List[Int] = List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
val fruits = List("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date")
                                                //> fruits  : List[String] = List(apple, banana, cherry, date)

def map[T, U](list: List[T], f: T => U): List[U] =
  for (x <- list) yield f(x)                    //> map: [T, U](list: List[T], f: T => U)List[U]
map(list, (n: Int) => n * 2)                    //> res0: List[Int] = List(0, 2, 4, 6, 8)

def flatMap[T, U](xs: List[T], f: T => List[U]): List[U] =
  for (x <- xs; y <- f(x)) yield y              //> flatMap: [T, U](xs: List[T], f: T => List[U])List[U]
flatMap(fruits, (str: String) => str.toList)    //> res1: List[Char] = List(a, p, p, l, e, b, a, n, a, n, a, c, h, e, r, r, y, d
                                                //| , a, t, e)

def filter[T](xs: List[T], f: T => Boolean): List[T] =
  for (x <- xs if f(x)) yield x                 //> filter: [T](xs: List[T], f: T => Boolean)List[T]
filter(list, (n: Int) => n % 2 == 0)            //> res2: List[Int] = List(0, 2, 4)
```
