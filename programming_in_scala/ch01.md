# A Scalable Language

Scala’s functional programming constructs make it easy to build interesting things quickly from simple parts. Its object-oriented constructs make it easy to structure larger systems and to adapt them to new demands. The combination of both styles in Scala makes it possible to express new kinds of programming patterns and component abstractions. It also leads to a legible and concise programming style.
 
## A language that grows on you

### Growing new types

Instead of providing all constructs you might ever need in one “perfectly complete” language, Scala puts the tools for building such constructs into your hands.

Scala allows users to grow and adapt the language in the directions they need by defining easy-to-use libraries that feel like native language support.

### Growing new control constructs

Java comes with a rich, thread-based concurrency library. Scala pro- grams can use it like any other Java API. However, Scala also offers an ad- ditional library that essentially implements Erlang’s actor model.

Actors are concurrency abstractions that can be implemented on top of threads. They communicate by sending messages to each other. An actor can perform two basic operations, message send and receive.

All in all, actors have turned out to be a very pleasant means for expressing concurrent and distributed computations. Even though they are defined in a library, actors feel like an integral part of the Scala language.
