# Classes and Objects

## 4.1 Classes, fields, and methods

A class is a blueprint for objects. Once you define a class, you can create objects from the class blueprint with the keyword new.

Inside a class definition, you place fields and methods, which are collectively called *members*. 
- Fields, which you define with either `val` or `var`, are variables that refer to objects. The fields hold the state, or data, of an object.
- Methods, which you define with `def`, contain executable code. The methods use that data to do the computational work of the object. 

```scala
class ChecksumAccumulator {
  private var sum = 0
}

val acc = new ChecksumAccumulator
val csa = new ChecksumAccumulator
```

The first step is to prevent outsiders from accessing the fields directly by making the fields `private`.
- you’d say “public” in Java, you simply say nothing in Scala. Public is Scala’s default access level.
