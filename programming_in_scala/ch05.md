# Basic Types and Operations

## 5.1 Some basic types

Collectively, types `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long`, and `Char` are called *integral types*. 
The integral types plus `Float` and `Double` are called *numeric types*.

`String` resides in package `java.lang`.

## 5.2 Literals

All of the basic types listed in Table 5.1 can be written with `literals`.
A literal is a way to write a constant value directly in code.

### Integer literals

Integer literals for the types `Int`, `Long`, `Short`, and `Byte` come in three forms: decimal, hexadecimal, and octal. 
- If the number begins with a `0x` or `0X`, it is hexadecimal (base 16), and may contain 0 through 9 as well as upper or lowercase digits A through F.
- If the number begins with a zero, it is octal (base 8), and may, therefore, only contain digits 0 through 7.
- If the number begins with a non-zero digit, and is otherwise undecorated, it is decimal (base 10)

```scala
scala> val hex = 0xdeadbeef
hex: Int = -559038737

scala> val oct = 035
<console>:1: error: Decimal integer literals may not have a leading zero. (Octal syntax is obsolete.)
val oct = 035
          ^

scala> val dec = 31
```

If an integer literal ends in an `L` or `l`, it is a `Long`, otherwise it is an `Int`. 

```scala
scala> val num1 = 123
num1: Int = 123

scala> val num2 = 123L
num2: Long = 123
```

If an Int literal is assigned to a variable of type `Short` or `Byte`, the literal is treated as if it were a `Short` or `Byte` type so long as the literal value is within the valid range for that type.

```scala
scala> val byte: Byte = 10
byte: Byte = 10

scala> val short = 10: Short
short: Short = 10
```

### Floating point literals

Floating point literals are made up of decimal digits, optionally containing a decimal point, and optionally followed by an `E` or `e` and an exponent.

```scala
scala> val big = 1.2345
big: Double = 1.2345

scala> val bigger = 1.2345e1
bigger: Double = 12.345
```

If a floating-point literal ends in an `F` or `f`, it is a `Float`, otherwise it is a `Double`. Optionally, a Double floating-point literal can end in `D` or `d`.

```scala
scala> val float = 1.2345e1f
float: Float = 12.345

scala> val double = 1.2345e2D
double: Double = 123.45
```

### Character literals

Character literals are composed of any Unicode character between single quotes(`'`).
- The octal number must be between `'\0'` and `'\377'`.
- A character literal can also be given as a general Unicode character consisting of four hex digits and preceded by a `\u`.

```scala
scala> val a = 'A'
a: Char = A

scala> val a = '\101'
warning: there was one deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
a: Char = A

scala> val a = '\u0041'
a: Char = A
```

### String literals

A string literal is composed of characters surrounded by double quotes.
- The syntax of the characters within the quotes is the same as with character literals.
- Scala includes a special syntax for *raw strings*. You start and end a raw string with three double quotation marks in a row (`"""`)

```scala
scala> val hello = "hello"
hello: String = hello

scala> val escapes = "\\\"\'"
escapes: String = \"'

scala> val multiline = """hello world
     | this is a test"""
multiline: String =
hello world
this is a test
```

### Symbol literals

A symbol literal is written `'ident`, where `ident` can be any alphanumeric identifier. Such literals are mapped to instances of the predefined class `scala.Symbol`. Specifically, the literal `'cymbal` will be expanded by the compiler to a factory method invocation: `Symbol("cymbal")`.

Symbol literals are typically used in situations where you would use just an identifier in a dynamically typed language. For instance, you might want to define a method that updates a record in a database:

```scala
scala> def updateRecordByName(r: Symbol, value: Any) {
     |   println(Symbol, value)
     | }
updateRecordByName: (r: Symbol, value: Any)Unit

scala> updateRecordByName('favoriteAlbum, "OK Computer")
(scala.Symbol$@21c64522,OK Computer)

scala> updateRecordByName(Symbol("favoriteAlbum"), "OK Computer")
(scala.Symbol$@21c64522,OK Computer)
```

### Boolean literals

The Boolean type has two literals, `true` and `false`.

```scala
scala> val foo = true
foo: Boolean = true

scala> val bar = false
bar: Boolean = false
```

## 5.3 Operators are methods

The operators are actually just a nice syntax for ordinary method calls. For example, `1 + 2` really means the same thing as `(1).+(2)`.
- The `+` symbol is an operator — an *infix* operator to be specific.

In *prefix* notation, you put the method name before the object on which you are invoking the method, for example, the ‘-’ in `-7`. In *postfix* notation, you put the method after the object, for example, the “toLong” in `7 toLong`.

As with the infix operators, these prefix operators are a shorthand way of invoking methods. In this case, however, the name of the method has “unary_” prepended to the operator character.
- `-2` = `2.unary_-`

Postfix operators are methods that take no arguments, when they are invoked without a dot or parentheses. In Scala, you can leave off empty parentheses on method calls.
```scala
scala> s.toLowerCase
res15: String = hello, world!

scala> s.toLowerCase()
res16: String = hello, world!

scala> import scala.language.postfixOps
import scala.language.postfixOps

scala> s toLowerCase
res17: String = hello, world!
```

## 5.4 Arithmetic operations

You can invoke arithmetic methods via infix operator notation for addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and remainder (`%`), on any numeric type. 

## 5.5 Relational and logical operations

You can compare numeric types with relational methods greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`), which yield a `Boolean` result. In addition, you can use the unary `!` operator (the unary_! method) to invert a `Boolean` value.

The logical methods, logical-and (`&&`) and logical-or (`||`), take `Boolean` operands in infix notation and yield a `Boolean` result.

The logical-and and logical-or operations are *short-circuited* as in Java: expressions built from these operators are only evaluated as far as needed to determine the result.

```scala
scala> def salt() = { println("salt"); false }
salt: ()Boolean

scala> def pepper() = { println("pepper"); true }
pepper: ()Boolean

scala> pepper() && salt()
pepper
salt
res2: Boolean = false

scala> salt() && pepper()
salt
res3: Boolean = false
```

## 5.6 Bitwise operations

Scala enables you to perform operations on individual bits of integer types with several bitwise methods. The bitwise methods are: bitwise-and (`&`), bitwise-or (`|`), and bitwise-xor (`ˆ`).

Scala integer types also offer three shift methods: shift left (`<<`), shift right (`>>`), and unsigned shift right (`>>>`).

```scala
scala> -1 >> 31
res4: Int = -1

scala> -1 >>> 31
res5: Int = 1
```
- `-1` in binary is `11111111111111111111111111111111`
- Since the `>>` method *fills with ones* as it shifts right, because the leftmost bit of `-1` is `1`, the result is identical to the original left operand, `32` one bits, or `-1`.
- In the second example, `-1 >>> 31`, the leftmost bit is again shifted right until it is in the rightmost position, but this time *filling with zeroes* along the way.

## 5.7 Object equality

If you want to compare two objects for equality, you can use either `==`, or its inverse `!=`.

```scala
scala> List(1,2,3) == null
res7: Boolean = false

scala> null == List(1,2,3)
res8: Boolean = false
```
- This is accomplished with a very simple rule: first check the left side for `null`, and if it is not `null`, call the equals method. 

```scala
scala> ("he"+"llo") == "hello"
res9: Boolean = true
```
- This kind of comparison will yield `true` on different objects, so long as their *contents* are the same and their equals method is written to be based on contents.

```scala
class Foo(_n: Int) {
  private val n = _n
  override def equals(other: Any) = other match {
    case that: Foo => this.n == that.n
    case _         => false
  }
}

val f1 = new Foo(1)                             //> f1  : myTest.test18.Foo = myTest.test18$$anonfun$main$1$Foo$1@2552f0fc
val f2 = new Foo(1)                             //> f2  : myTest.test18.Foo = myTest.test18$$anonfun$main$1$Foo$1@684b4388

f1 == f2                                        //> res0: Boolean = true
```

## 5.8 Operator precedence and associativity

Operator precedence determines which parts of an expression are evaluated before the other parts. For example, the expression `2 + 2 * 7` evaluates to `16`, not `28`, because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator.

```scala
scala> 2 << 2 + 2
res10: Int = 32
```
- Thus `<<` will have lower precedence than `+`, and the expression will be evaluated by first invoking the `+` method, then the `<<` method, as in `2 << (2 + 2)`. 

The one exception to the precedence rule, alluded to above, concerns assignment operators, which end in an equals character. If an operator ends in an equals character (`=`), and the operator is not one of the comparison operators `<=`, `>=`, `==`, or `!=`, then the precedence of the operator is the same as that of simple assignment (`=`). That is, it is lower than the precedence of any other operator.
- `x *= y + 1` means the same as `x *= (y + 1)`

Any method that ends in a `:` character is invoked on its *right operand*, passing in the left operand.
- `a ::: b` means the same as `(b).:::(a)`

## 5.9 Rich wrappers

You can invoke many more methods on Scala’s basic types than were described in the previous sections. These methods are available via *implicit conversions*.

```scala
scala> 0 max 5
res11: Int = 5

scala> 4 to 6
res12: scala.collection.immutable.Range.Inclusive = Range(4, 5, 6)

scala> "bob" capitalize
res13: String = Bob
```
```
