# Basic Types and Operations

## 5.1 Some basic types

Collectively, types `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long`, and `Char` are called *integral types*. 
The integral types plus `Float` and `Double` are called *numeric types*.

`String` resides in package `java.lang`.

## 5.2 Literals

All of the basic types listed in Table 5.1 can be written with `literals`.
A literal is a way to write a constant value directly in code.

### Integer literals

Integer literals for the types `Int`, `Long`, `Short`, and `Byte` come in three forms: decimal, hexadecimal, and octal. 
- If the number begins with a `0x` or `0X`, it is hexadecimal (base 16), and may contain 0 through 9 as well as upper or lowercase digits A through F.
- If the number begins with a zero, it is octal (base 8), and may, therefore, only contain digits 0 through 7.
- If the number begins with a non-zero digit, and is otherwise undecorated, it is decimal (base 10)

```scala
scala> val hex = 0xdeadbeef
hex: Int = -559038737

scala> val oct = 035
<console>:1: error: Decimal integer literals may not have a leading zero. (Octal syntax is obsolete.)
val oct = 035
          ^

scala> val dec = 31
```

If an integer literal ends in an `L` or `l`, it is a `Long`, otherwise it is an `Int`. 
```scala
scala> val num1 = 123
num1: Int = 123

scala> val num2 = 123L
num2: Long = 123
```

If an Int literal is assigned to a variable of type `Short` or `Byte`, the literal is treated as if it were a `Short` or `Byte` type so long as the literal value is within the valid range for that type.
```scala
scala> val byte: Byte = 10
byte: Byte = 10

scala> val short = 10: Short
short: Short = 10
```
