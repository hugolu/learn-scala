# Basic Types and Operations

## 5.1 Some basic types

Collectively, types `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long`, and `Char` are called *integral types*. 
The integral types plus `Float` and `Double` are called *numeric types*.

`String` resides in package `java.lang`.

## 5.2 Literals

All of the basic types listed in Table 5.1 can be written with `literals`.
A literal is a way to write a constant value directly in code.

### Integer literals

Integer literals for the types `Int`, `Long`, `Short`, and `Byte` come in three forms: decimal, hexadecimal, and octal. 
- If the number begins with a `0x` or `0X`, it is hexadecimal (base 16), and may contain 0 through 9 as well as upper or lowercase digits A through F.
- If the number begins with a zero, it is octal (base 8), and may, therefore, only contain digits 0 through 7.
- If the number begins with a non-zero digit, and is otherwise undecorated, it is decimal (base 10)

```scala
scala> val hex = 0xdeadbeef
hex: Int = -559038737

scala> val oct = 035
<console>:1: error: Decimal integer literals may not have a leading zero. (Octal syntax is obsolete.)
val oct = 035
          ^

scala> val dec = 31
```

If an integer literal ends in an `L` or `l`, it is a `Long`, otherwise it is an `Int`. 

```scala
scala> val num1 = 123
num1: Int = 123

scala> val num2 = 123L
num2: Long = 123
```

If an Int literal is assigned to a variable of type `Short` or `Byte`, the literal is treated as if it were a `Short` or `Byte` type so long as the literal value is within the valid range for that type.

```scala
scala> val byte: Byte = 10
byte: Byte = 10

scala> val short = 10: Short
short: Short = 10
```

### Floating point literals

Floating point literals are made up of decimal digits, optionally containing a decimal point, and optionally followed by an `E` or `e` and an exponent.

```scala
scala> val big = 1.2345
big: Double = 1.2345

scala> val bigger = 1.2345e1
bigger: Double = 12.345
```

If a floating-point literal ends in an `F` or `f`, it is a `Float`, otherwise it is a `Double`. Optionally, a Double floating-point literal can end in `D` or `d`.

```scala
scala> val float = 1.2345e1f
float: Float = 12.345

scala> val double = 1.2345e2D
double: Double = 123.45
```

### Character literals

Character literals are composed of any Unicode character between single quotes(`'`).
- The octal number must be between `'\0'` and `'\377'`.
- A character literal can also be given as a general Unicode character consisting of four hex digits and preceded by a `\u`.

```scala
scala> val a = 'A'
a: Char = A

scala> val a = '\101'
warning: there was one deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
a: Char = A

scala> val a = '\u0041'
a: Char = A
```

### String literals

A string literal is composed of characters surrounded by double quotes.
- The syntax of the characters within the quotes is the same as with character literals.
- Scala includes a special syntax for *raw strings*. You start and end a raw string with three double quotation marks in a row (`"""`)

```scala
scala> val hello = "hello"
hello: String = hello

scala> val escapes = "\\\"\'"
escapes: String = \"'

scala> val multiline = """hello world
     | this is a test"""
multiline: String =
hello world
this is a test
```

### Symbol literals

A symbol literal is written `'ident`, where `ident` can be any alphanumeric identifier. Such literals are mapped to instances of the predefined class `scala.Symbol`. Specifically, the literal `'cymbal` will be expanded by the compiler to a factory method invocation: `Symbol("cymbal")`.

Symbol literals are typically used in situations where you would use just an identifier in a dynamically typed language. For instance, you might want to define a method that updates a record in a database:

```scala
scala> def updateRecordByName(r: Symbol, value: Any) {
     |   println(Symbol, value)
     | }
updateRecordByName: (r: Symbol, value: Any)Unit

scala> updateRecordByName('favoriteAlbum, "OK Computer")
(scala.Symbol$@21c64522,OK Computer)

scala> updateRecordByName(Symbol("favoriteAlbum"), "OK Computer")
(scala.Symbol$@21c64522,OK Computer)
```

### Boolean literals

The Boolean type has two literals, `true` and `false`.

```scala
scala> val foo = true
foo: Boolean = true

scala> val bar = false
bar: Boolean = false
```
