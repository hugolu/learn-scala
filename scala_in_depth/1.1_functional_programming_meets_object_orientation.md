# Functional Programming meets Object Orientation

## Object-oriented approach
```scala
class Bird
class Cat {
  def catch(b: Bird): Unit = {}
  def eat(): Unit = {}
}

val cat = new Cat
val bird = new Bird

cat.catch(bird)
cat.eat()
```

## Functional approach
```scala
trait Cat
trait Bird
trait Catch
trait FullTummy

def catch(hunter: Cat, prey: Bird): Cat with Catch
def eat(consumer: Cat with Catch): Cat with FullTummy

val story = (catch _) andThen (eat _)
story(new Cat, new Bird)
```
